# EKKO

This is an open-source RISC-V soft-core microcontroller targeting the ZYBO FPGA board. It uses the [Ibex RISC-V soft-core](https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex) and the following features:

* RISC-V debug support (using the [PULP RISC-V Debug Module](https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv-dbg))
* AXI Bus
* Timer
* I2C

The architecture is presented in the following picture.
